            This is a simple game that demonstrates some of the initial coding techniques and practices I learned when I first began coding.
            These include working with lists, if/else statements, user defined methods and classes, etc.
            It provided a good basis for learning and working with other languages.</figcaption>

          <figcaption id = "sudoku" class="caption">Sudoku Solver made with <b>C</b> using a <b>recursive back-tracking algorithm</b>.
          Recursive back-tracking is different from regular recursion as back-tracking means it searches all possibilities until it finds a correct solution (sodoku requirements in this case),
          while recursion simply means the function calling itself until it reaches a base case. This program really highlights much of the knowledge
          I have learned in programming thus far.</figcaption>
